# wikipedia-search
FCC Project: A responsive webapp that uses the MediaWiki API to generate Wikipedia search results.  Users have an option to view a random Wikipedia page.    Search results are ordered by relevance and include photo thumbnails if there is one available currently on the corresponding Wikipedia page.  The search bar is decorated with CSS hover and transition effects.
